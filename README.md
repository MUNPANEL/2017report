## 引言 Intro

从 2016 年 11 月 21 日上线以来，MUNPANEL 已伴随各位开过了 BJMUNC 2017、BJMUNSS 2017 与 ROMUNC 2017。我们很荣幸服务了超过 170 个注册社团、覆盖全国 34 个省的 2000 余名用户的二十余万次访问。

自始至终，MUNPANEL 的侧重点并非会议报名，也非学术文档作业等会议功能，而是构造一个将每一个模联人联系在一起的平台。设想一个未来，使用手中的一个账号，您可以自主创建一场新的会议，邀请其他组委成员共同管理；使用手中的一个账号，您可以以代表、志>愿者抑或是观察员的身份，加入任何一场会议，甚至是基于参会历史得到匹配您的水平的会议推荐；使用一个账号，您可以管理及参与社团的内部事宜，无论是招新、校内培训还是组织参会；使用一个账号，您可以查看您一路走来的足迹，与志同道合的人共同分享成功的
喜悦。而这一切，并非遥不可及的梦想。

正如我们在 11 月 21 日发布通告中所提及的“将原本分散的模块进行整合，以统一面板的形式将会议升高到一个全新的维度”，在研发的过程中，我们始终未忘“整合”的理念——不仅仅整合一场会议从开始到结尾的报名、缴费、作业提交、文件下载、智能分配搭档室友、席
位分配、线上商城购物等等，也不仅仅是将模联软件系统整合——用同一套账户系统整合、联动模联中用到的软件，更是将中国中学生模拟联合国活动整合。而正是构建平台并使功能通用化的的这一思路，使得开发的过程无比得艰难。我们为过去一年内平台曾出现过的种种
问题感到抱歉，更感谢一路走来陪伴我们、理解我们、支持我们的各位模联人。

作为一个以人为核心的平台，我们深知会议、社团的重要性，但更不忘我们 B2C 的通用平台服务理念。我们也很欣慰地看到像 MUNPASS 在内的一些小型会议报名系统的出现，也很感激冯凯佳先生对开源社区做的努力，更感谢 Console iT、MUNCS 等团队在模拟联合国会>议主持软件方面所做的努力。正是这些人的努力，使得模拟联合国数字化离我们更近一步。

在技术层面，我们深知开源社区的重要性，更重视每一位有志向走上开发道路的开发者，无论是否在模拟联合国领域。在已经开源 MUNPANEL 代表牌生成中的部分代码后，在未来我们还将开源更多在开发 MUNPANEL 过程中研发的底层基础架构、分析算法、以及面向开发者
的工具。

在未来的一段时间内，我们将继续整合化平台研发，在自主创建、配置、管理会议与社团功能完善之后，以全新的面貌与更佳的用户体验与大家见面。在那之前，我们将不与任何会议或社团合作。若您关于 MUNPANEL 平台有任何期望或建议，欢迎访问 https://gdgdocs.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4H-KOIAHIvOMxAKYeOzTMZCHbtaSR4hxAJRZTNUTvyrGLig/viewform ，您的反馈对我们无比重要。如果您的社团或会议希望在第一时间体验整合平台带来的便利，欢迎访问 https://gdgdocs.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfDYeuLAdw1JvVTt0Agpx-H9aQgq12-IYJEERANdKqFZbdrPA/viewform 加入 MUNPANEL Trusted Teser 计划，我们将在内测阶段邀请您体验，也更期待您的反馈。如您希望为全新 MUNPANEL 平台贡献一份力，也欢迎您申请加入 MUNPANEL 团队（不仅限于软件开发），详情请访问 https://goo.gl/forms/eX5WF8oNRiMnHZ5m2（需科学地访问并登陆 Google 账号）。

希望这份报告可以带您回顾 MUNPANEL 过去一年的发展，也期待在不久的将来再次和您见面！


Since its release on November 21, 2016, MUNPANEL has accompanied you participating in BJMUNC 2017, BJMUNSS 2017 \& ROMUNC 2017. We are proud to have served more than 170 registered clubs, and 200,000+ visits from 2,000+ users from all 34 provinces in China.

Since the very beginning, MUNPANEL's focus is never on conference registration; nor is it on functions like documents and assignments, but on creating a platform that links every MUNer together. Imagine a future, when you can use a single account to self-create a conference and invite other co-organizers. Imagine a future, when you can use a single account to participate in any conference as either a delegate, volunteer or observer, and even get conference recommendation that matches your MUN skills based on your participation history. Imagine a future, when you can use a single account to administrate and participate in internal affairs of your club, no matter if you are recruiting, training, or organizing members to sign up for conferences. Imagine a future, when you can use a single account to view your footsteps on the path of Model UN and share your success with like-minded fellows. That future is not a dream.

As mentioned in our release announcement on Nov. 21, "to integrate the separate modules together, and push conferences to a brand new dimension in a unfied form", we never forgot the idea of "integration" in our development process. We are not only integrating everything needed from the beginning to the very end of a conference - registration, paying fee, handing in assignments, downloading documents, smart roommate and partner pairing, nation assigning, online store, etc. Nor are we only integrating all systems and software used in Model UN with a unfied account system. More importantly, we are integrating Model UN as a whole. It is the very idea of building a general and integrated platform, that makes our development much more difficult than usual. We apologize for any problems you might have run into during the past year, and are grateful for you, MUNers who are always understanding us and supporting us.

Building a platform for MUNers, we understand the importance of conferences and clubs, but we also remember our B2C model. We are grateful to see the emergence of some small-scale conference registration service like MUNPASS, and thank for the efforts of Mr. Kaijia for his contributions to the open-source community. We also appreciate the efforts of teams including Console iT and MUNCS to build awesome conference moderating software. It is their efforts that make us closer to the ultimate goal of Model UN digitalization.

In the technological facet, we understand and significance of open-source community, and value every developer, no matter in the field of Model UN or not. After open-sourcing part of the code in generating badge images for conferences, we will continue to open-source even more, especially in some network/server infrastructure-level software and developer-facing tools we developed while building MUNPANEL.

In the next period of time, we will continue integrating the platform, and will release a brand new version after finalizing the functions related to the self-creation and self-configuration of new conferences on the platform. Until then, we won't cooperate with other conferences or clubs so that we can focus on improving our user expierience. If you have any expectations or suggestions of MUNPANEL, please visit https://gdgdocs.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4H-KOIAHIvOMxAKYeOzTMZCHbtaSR4hxAJRZTNUTvyrGLig/viewform. Your feedback is extremely important for us. If you want to enjoy the convenience brought by the new MUNPANEL at the first time, please opt in the MUNPANEL Trusted Tester program at https://gdgdocs.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfDYeuLAdw1JvVTt0Agpx-H9aQgq12-IYJEERANdKqFZbdrPA/viewform. We will invite you for future alpha tests, and your ideas could potentially determine the future path of MUNPANEL. If you wish to contribute your skills to the new MUNPANEL, you are more than welcomed to apply to join the MUNPANEL team (not limited to software engineering), please visit https://goo.gl/forms/eX5WF8oNRiMnHZ5m2 for details (requires to log in with a Google account, and needs special network conditions if you are in Mainland China).

We hope that this report can serve as a retrospect of the development of MUNPANEL in the past year, and hope to see you again soon!
